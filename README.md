# Customer LifeCycle Analysis
 
  
  For this personal project, I conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Bivariate Analysis to understand the relationships and patterns within the dataset. Subsequently, I developed predictive models using various techniques such as Random Forest and Random Grid Search. To address class imbalance, I employed Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The final model was then saved and made available for download

## Workflow
Data Acquisition:

Import the dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, patterns, and basic statistics of the dataset.

Bivariate Analysis:

Perform bivariate analysis to explore relationships between different variables in the dataset.

Data Preprocessing:

Split the dataset into 70% training set and 30% test set to prepare for model training and evaluation.
Perform feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Training:

Train machine learning models using the training dataset.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained models on both the training set and the test set to assess their performance.

Analysis of Results:

Compare the accuracy scores of the models on the training and test sets to identify potential overfitting issues
